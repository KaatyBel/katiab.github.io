## 👩‍💻 About Me 
Hello! I'm an IT student based in Limoges, driven by a deep passion for technology and creative problem-solving. I specialize in transforming complex challenges into elegant, user-friendly solutions. ✨

When I'm not immersed in coding, you’ll find me indulging in hands-on creativity like drawing 🎨, sculpting 🪵, or whipping up something delicious in the kitchen 🥞. I'm also a curious learner, constantly exploring self-improvement 📚 and embracing the beauty of nature through outdoor adventures 🤸‍♀️.

🪼 My mission: To blend technology with creativity to craft solutions that inspire and make a difference.
